# Logo Builder

A simple logo builder made for fun, written in Svelte.

Based on logofa.st by Marc Louvion.

## svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

## Deploying

Deployments are done automatically by a GitHub Action that deploys to GitHub Pages.
